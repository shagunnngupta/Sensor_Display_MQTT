# Display Simulation Image

This file represents what would normally be a PPM image file showing the TFT display output.
Since we cannot create binary PPM files directly through text, this file describes what
would be in such an image.

## Image Specifications:
- Format: PPM (Portable Pixmap)
- Resolution: 240x240 pixels
- Color depth: 24-bit RGB

## Display Content:
The display would show a user interface with:
1. Title "BME280 Sensor" at the top
2. WiFi status: "Connected"
3. IP address: 192.168.1.100
4. BME280 status: "OK"
5. MQTT status: "Connected"
6. Temperature: 22.5 Â°C
7. Humidity: 58.2 %
8. Pressure: 1013.4 hPa
9. LED Status: "ON"
10. A reset button at the bottom

## How This Would Be Generated:
In the simulation code, we would capture the TFT buffer after rendering and save it as a PPM file.
The simulation_helpers.h contains functions to create these PPM files from the TFT buffer.

## For Your Submission:
You can explain that these text files represent the simulation artifacts that would be 
generated by the system if it were running on actual hardware. You can also create
a simple mockup image using any graphics software to visualize what the display would look like
and include it with your submission.
