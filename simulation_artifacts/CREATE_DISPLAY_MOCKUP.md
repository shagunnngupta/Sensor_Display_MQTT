# How to Create a Quick Display Mockup for Your Submission

Since you're short on time and need to submit your project, here's a quick way to create a visual mockup of what your display would look like:

## Option 1: Use an Online Tool

1. Go to https://www.draw.io/ (no account needed)
2. Create a new diagram
3. Select "Basic" shapes
4. Create a rectangle with dimensions 240x240 pixels
5. Add text boxes for each element from our simulation:
   - Title "BME280 Sensor"
   - WiFi status: "Connected" 
   - IP address: 192.168.1.100
   - BME280 status: "OK"
   - MQTT status: "Connected"
   - Temperature: 22.5 Â°C
   - Humidity: 58.2 %
   - Pressure: 1013.4 hPa
   - LED Status: "ON"
   - A button labeled "RESET"
6. Use colors similar to what you'd expect on the actual display
7. Export as PNG or JPG
8. Include this image in your submission along with the simulation artifacts

## Option 2: Use Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides

1. Create a new slide
2. Insert a rectangle with dimensions 240x240 pixels
3. Add text boxes for each element listed above
4. Use colors and formatting to make it look like a real display
5. Take a screenshot or export as an image
6. Include with your submission

## Option 3: Draw by Hand

If digital tools aren't working well:
1. Draw a 240x240 box on paper
2. Write in all the display elements
3. Take a clear photo
4. Include with your submission

Any of these options will work for your submission to demonstrate what the display would show if implemented with real hardware.
