# Submission Instructions

Since you're running short on time, here's what you need to submit for your project:

## Required Files

1. **Code Files**:
   - All source files in `src/` folder
   - All header files in `include/` folder
   - The `platformio.ini` file

2. **Simulation Artifacts** (from the simulation_artifacts folder):
   - `sensor_readings.csv` - Shows BME280 sensor data
   - `system_simulation_log.txt` - Shows system operation
   - `mqtt_simulation_log.txt` - Shows MQTT communication
   - A display mockup image you create using the instructions in CREATE_DISPLAY_MOCKUP.md

3. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Project overview
   - `system_architecture.txt` - System design explanation
   - Any additional notes on how you would implement with real hardware

## Explaining the Simulation

In your submission, make sure to explain:

1. That you've created a simulation-based implementation due to lack of physical hardware access
2. How the system would work if implemented with real components
3. That the simulation artifacts represent the expected behavior of the real system

## Submission Steps

1. Zip all the required files mentioned above
2. Make sure to create at least one display mockup image using the instructions provided
3. Submit the zip file to your assignment portal

Good luck with your submission!
